## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 10 do you deserve on this assignment: 9

## Self-Reflection:
The lab guide was easy to follow and I didnt have much issues with section I had to fill out myself such as the testing portion. Although I did run into one issue where a test kept failing because it was reciving "lose" instead of "lost" and I couldnt figure out why because there were no typos. I ended up just taking the code out and putting it back which seemed to fix it.

### How long it took me to finish this?
About 1hr 30minutes
